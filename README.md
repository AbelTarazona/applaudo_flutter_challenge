## Getting Started

For testing purposes you must first generate a token from the postman provided to me. Then, assign the value to bearerToken in the folder "lib/core/utils/constants.dart".

## Some observations
- For personal and work reasons, I have not been able to complete the application, however, it contains the main parts of a scalable app.
- More documentation on APIs was missing. For example: 
  - There was no API for refreshing the token.
  - There was a lack of definition on how to use filters in the data fetching APIs.
  - The structure of the responses could have been more concise, without a lot of nesting.
